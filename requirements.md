4. WHEN no relevant code is found, THE AI_Tutor SHALL suggest alternative search terms or related concepts
5. WHEN answering questions, THE AI_Tutor SHALL maintain conversation history for contextual follow-up questions

### Requirement 4: Learning Spec Generation and Export

**User Story:** As a Learner, I want to import structured learning tasks into Kiro IDE, so that I can track my progress through the onboarding curriculum.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a learning path is generated, THE System SHALL create Learning_Specs with specific, actionable tasks
2. WHEN creating Learning_Specs, THE System SHALL include task descriptions, file references, and completion criteria
3. WHEN exporting Learning_Specs, THE System SHALL format them for direct import into Kiro IDE
4. WHEN Learning_Specs are imported to Kiro, THE Progress_Tracker SHALL receive completion status updates
5. WHEN tasks are completed in Kiro, THE System SHALL update learner progress and confidence scores

### Requirement 5: Progress Tracking and Analytics

**User Story:** As a Manager, I want to monitor junior developer progress and confidence levels, so that I can identify when additional support is needed and measure onboarding effectiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Learner completes learning tasks, THE Progress_Tracker SHALL record completion timestamps and confidence ratings
2. WHEN tracking progress, THE System SHALL calculate time-to-productivity metrics for each learner
3. WHEN displaying analytics, THE System SHALL show completion percentages, confidence trends, and time spent per domain
4. WHEN learners struggle with specific concepts, THE System SHALL flag areas requiring manager intervention
5. WHEN generating reports, THE System SHALL provide comparative analytics across multiple junior hires

### Requirement 6: User Authentication and Authorization

**User Story:** As a user of the system, I want secure access control, so that only authorized personnel can access sensitive codebase information and learner data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the platform, THE System SHALL authenticate via Amazon Cognito with multi-factor authentication support
2. WHEN authenticating Managers, THE System SHALL verify organizational permissions for codebase access
3. WHEN authenticating Learners, THE System SHALL restrict access to assigned learning paths and associated codebases
4. WHEN sessions expire, THE System SHALL require re-authentication before accessing sensitive data
5. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted, THE System SHALL log security events and deny access

### Requirement 7: Manager Dashboard and Reporting

**User Story:** As a Manager, I want a comprehensive dashboard showing team onboarding status, so that I can make data-driven decisions about developer productivity and support needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard, THE System SHALL display real-time completion status for all assigned learners
2. WHEN viewing team metrics, THE System SHALL show average time-to-productivity across different codebases
3. WHEN analyzing progress, THE System SHALL highlight learners who may need additional support based on completion rates
4. WHEN generating reports, THE System SHALL provide exportable analytics for stakeholder communication
5. WHEN comparing performance, THE System SHALL show trends in onboarding effectiveness over time

### Requirement 8: Codebase Vector Indexing and Search

**User Story:** As a system component, I want to create searchable representations of codebases, so that the AI_Tutor can provide accurate and contextual responses to learner questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria
